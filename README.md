# R Subsetting Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when subsetting data frames in R using character vectors to specify column names. The bug arises from incorrect syntax in using the `[` operator.

The `bug.R` file contains the erroneous code that causes the "undefined columns selected" error. The `bugSolution.R` file provides the corrected code.

This is a simple example of a subtle error that can cause significant problems when working with data.
